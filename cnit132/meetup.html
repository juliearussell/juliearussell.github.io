<!-- write any stuff here and do not worry, it will not show up in the browser 
Assignment info:
DONE 1- Your page should have an image of your participation (can be a selfie or a picture of your screen).
DONE 3- In the content, you should create a link to the MeetUp page or video of the tutorial you "attended."
DONE 2- You should write a couple of paragraphs about the group (objectives, the frequency they meet (or post videos), the subject of the meeting you attended, what you learned, etc.).

4- After you build your page, upload it to the Hills Server and post the URL here in the text box below.

TODOS:
+ add all the css stuff!  maybe external css file? -> trying with the finalproject.css - add flexbox!
+ make this a flex box thing, or use the same css as  finalproject.html/css ? 
+ add favicon
+ check all the SEO and A11Y things!
+ resize images to fit the screen - also probably resize for faster loading!
+ what if I used something to "read" this page to me?
+ what if I thought about contrasting colors, for colorblind?
+ check color scheme for finalproject.css used here
+ check for TK's and remove them!
+ white hyperlinks on this light background don't work ...

EXAMPLES:
Include image:
<p><img src="kissed-by-a-dolphin.jpg" alt="Octavio the dolphin kisses Julie the human"></p>

if I want to use external css:
<link rel="stylesheet" href="finalproject.css">

<h1>Lesbians Who Tech (& Allies!) Summit<br> 
	San Francisco, October 2022</h1>
	<p> CNIT132 MeetUp Assignment, Fall 2022</p>
<p><img src="img_lwt/Q_Design_for_disability_first.png" alt="Quote: When we design for disability first, we often stumble upon solutions that are not only inclusive but also are often better (than) when we design for the norm. By Elise Roy">

<p>Spoiling the ending, this quote epitomizes what I learned from attending this presentation. The speaker, Layshi, began by sharing an anecdote of working with a friend who was visually impaired, and how that inspired them to design for accessibilty, or A11Y (because there are eleven letters between the A & Y).  I am a prolific reader, and if I couldn't "see" websites with my eyes, I would also rely on how sites were designed to be accessible for those who are visually impaired.  What if we designed for those with disabilities first?  What creativity would that spark?<br>
Agenda for the session:
<p><img src="img_lwt/V_agenda.png" alt="Session agenda: main pillars that contribute to page experience: accessibility, user experience, search engine optimization; building an experience with A11Y, UX, and SEO in mind; trending in 2023 algorithms"></p>

More specifically, I learned about how A11Y, User Experience (UX), and SEO are intertwined, or, the Three Caballeros, as the speaker coined:
<p><img src="img_lwt/V_three_caballeros.png" alt="Cartoon of Donald Duck and two other characters, with the caption Please don't forget the three caballeros; SEO, A11Y, & UX"></p>

<h2>Page experience considerations, and how to design with A11Y in mind for these:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Page Headings - which help provide structure for text on a page and organize content into smaller sections so it's easy for visitors and search engines to navigate.  This can be done by increasing contrast, having a strong heirarchy, and adding diversity.</li>
	<li>Page Speed - the average page load speed for websites is 10.3 seconds on desktops, 27.3 seconds on mobile. It's important to consider the page load speed of the time to first byte, fully loaded page, and first meaningful paint.  This can be done by adding value, rather that aesthetics, font choices, and use CSS animations rather than relying on complex Javascript.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Now, to prove I was in the virtual room, note my "JR" avatar in the top right corner!</h2>
<p><img src="img_lwt/SS_Q_Disability_first_800px_wide.png" alt="Screen shot of me attending the conference "></p>

<p>The Lesbians Who Tech & Allies conference occurs annually, and after our virtual-only pandemic life the past few years, 2022 was the return to a virtual and in-person hybrid conference. <br> 

From their <a href="https://https://lesbianswhotech.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a>, The Lesbians Who Tech & Allies organization is a community of LGBTQ women, non-binary, and trans individuals in and around tech, and the people who support them. <br>

The organization's goals are:<br>
<ul>
	<li>To be more visible to each other</li>
	<li>To be more visible to others</li>
	<li>To get more women, POC, queer, and trans people in technology</li>
	<li>To connect our community to other organizations and companies that are doing incredible work </li>
</ul>

As a <strong>fierce</strong> ally of the LGBTQIA+ community, and someone who identifies as a cis-woman who has worked in tech for over twenty years, this organization's goals and mission resonate deeply with me.<br>
<br>
I was unable to attend in person, but for students and those new to the industry, in person networking events, and building my personal network has been critical in learning, growing, and yes, finding employment, and connecting with like-minded people is fun!</a></p>
