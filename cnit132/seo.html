<header><h1>Helpful Tips for Better Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</h1></header>

<p>Everyone wants their website to show up at the top of a Google search and employing SEO suggestions can make that more likely.<br></p>

<h2>Here are a few ways to help search engines help you:</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Domain Name:<br> 
	Choose a domain name that is representative and easy to distinguish the purpose of one's company, organization, or website, <em>juliesdogcare.com</em> is better for Julie's Dog Care than <em>randomwords.com</em>.</li>

	<li>If the website will be referenced on social media, which is a good idea to increase site visitors, use Open Graph meta tags so that social media links use specific images. Find out more on <a href="https://ogp.me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Open Graph Protocol</a></li>

	<li>Don't even think about publishing your site without a meta description or title!  Google uses this information for their Search Engine Response Tag (SERP), which is <a href="https://backlinko.com/hub/seo/serps" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google's response to a user's search query</a>.</li>

	<li>Using relative links for pages on the same webserver is useful, especially when the dev or staging environment has a different domain name than production, but make sure to code the canonical link: &lt;link rel="canonical" href="https://mycompany.com/"&gt; so that googlebot and other webcrawlers do not duplicate the URL</li>

	<li>Errors are the enemy of SEO!  Validate html at <a href="https://validator.w3.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">W3.org</a> to find and resolve site errors.</li>

</ul>

<h2>There are many resources and articles available to help optimize SEO, here are a few:</h2>

	<li><a href="https://www.semrush.com/blog/diy-seo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Semrush Blog DIY SEO: Six Steps That Anyone Can Follow To Get Results</a><br>
		This blog post recommends first setting up search analytics, like <a href="https://google.com/analytics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Analytics</a>, to help determine how visible one's site is now. After that, search keywords visitors might use to find the site, and publish optimized content, including the most relevant keyword in the H1 heading.</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2022/01/24/how-to-improve-your-seo-campaign-in-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Forbes</a> has a recent article with a list of steps on improving one's SEO campaign in 2022<br> 
	The first tip is to optimize the website for page load speed, as site responsiveness plays a role on how long a visitor will stay on one's site.  Subsequent tips mirror those provided by Semrush: track your traffic (which can be done with Google Analytics), use accurate keywords, and more.</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.screamingfrog.co.uk/seo-spider/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Screaming Frog</a> is a well known SEO Optimization tool, despite its curious name.  The SEO Spider Tool is a website crawler that helps improve website SEO by auditing for common SEO issues including broken links, auditing redirects, analyse (they're British) page titles and meta data, generate site maps, and more.</li>
