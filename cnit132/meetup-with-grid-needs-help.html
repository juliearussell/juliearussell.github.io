<!-- write any stuff here and do not worry, it will not show up in the browser 
Assignment info:
DONE 1- Your page should have an image of your participation (can be a selfie or a picture of your screen).
DONE 3- In the content, you should create a link to the MeetUp page or video of the tutorial you "attended."

2- You should write a couple of paragraphs about the group (objectives, the frequency they meet (or post videos), the subject of the meeting you attended, what you learned, etc.).
NEXT: write about what I learned

4- After you build your page, upload it to the Hills Server and post the URL here in the text box below.

TODOS:
+ add all the css stuff!  maybe external css file? -> trying with the finalproject.css - add flexbox!
+ make this a flex box thing, or use the same css as  finalproject.html/css ? 
+ add favicon
+ check all the SEO and A11Y things!
+ resize images to fit the screen - also probably resize for faster loading!
+ what if I used something to "read" this page to me?
+ what if I thought about contrasting colors, for colorblind?
+ check color scheme for finalproject.css used here
+ check for TK's and remove them!
+ white hyperlinks on this light background don't work ...

EXAMPLES:
Include image:

<p><img src="img_lwt/Q_Design_for_disability_first.png" alt="Quote: When we design for disability first, we often stumble upon solutions that are not only inclusive but also are often better (than) when we design for the norm. By Elise Roy">

<p>Spoiling the ending, this quote epitomizes what I learned from attending this presentation. The speaker, Layshi, began by sharing an anecdote of working with a friend who was visually impaired, and how that inspired them to design for disability.  I am a prolific reader, and if I couldn't "see" websites with my eyes, I would also rely on how sites were designed to be accessible for those who are visually impaired.  What if we designed for those with disabilities first?  What creativity would that spark?<br>
	<br>
I have tried to design this page with accessibility, or A11Y as it's called because there are eleven letters between the A and Y in "accessibility".</p>

<p>The Lesbians Who Tech & Allies conference occurs annually, and after our virtual-only pandemic life the past few years, 2022 was the return to a virtual and in-person hybrid conference. <br> 

From their <a href="https://https://lesbianswhotech.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a>, The Lesbians Who Tech & Allies organization is a community of LGBTQ women, non-binary, and trans individuals in and around tech, and the people who support them. <br>

The organization's goals are:<br></p>
<ul>
	<li>To be more visible to each other</li>
	<li>To be more visible to others</li>
	<li>To get more women, POC, queer, and trans people in technology</li>
	<li>To connect our community to other organizations and companies that are doing incredible work </li>
</ul>

<p>As a <strong>fierce</strong> ally of the LGBTQIA+ community, and someone who identifies as a cis-woman who has worked in tech for over twenty years, this organization's goals and mission resonate deeply with me.<br>
<br>
I was unable to attend in person, but for students and those new to the industry, in person networking events, and building my personal network has been critical in learning, growing, and yes, finding employment, and connecting with like-minded people is fun!</a></p>
