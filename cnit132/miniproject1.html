<p><strong>About me:</strong> When I am not swimming with dolphins in Mexico, I work in tech, walk my dog, write fiction, practice yoga, and enjoy time with my friends.</p>

<p>My path into and around web development has been circuitous. I have worked in web infrastructure since 1998, along side designers, front end developers, applications developers, and the like. I'd never coded a web page until 1999 when I spun up a very amateurishly designed web magazine using MS Front Page. It was completely static html.  A few years later I created a marketing web page for a yoga business I started that never got off the ground. This design was a little better. You can see that site on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120715004039/http://yogadelivery.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wayback machine</a>.  In years since, I have continued working in web infrastructure, or giving the web code a place to call home, but haven't touched html until CS131H this semester.  I had forgotten how fun it is to create web pages, and the joy of seeing the pages go live on the Internet.

My favorite website is also my last employer, <a href="https://medium.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Medium</a>. I've always appreciated the clean design, the user generated content, and my team and I worked hard to keep the infrastructure operational behind the scenes.</p>

<!--Cleaned up the errors that W3 Validator found in the original code. -->

<h2> Original page content, tidied up a bit</h2>
<p><em>Wasn't sure if we were supposed to delete this, so I didn't :) </em></p>

<p>In this homework we will be changing this code to be a valid code in HTML5.</p>
<p>We will probably need to change a lot of details around the code and the basic idea of this Homework is to learn how to use the validator from W3C.</p>
<p><img src="oldboat.gif" alt="animated cartoon of brown wood boat with red and white striped sail">
The image you see here will be used a lot in many exercises we will be doing in class! This is an old boat, probably an old ship. One of those types used to transport heavy cargo in the old times?!?! Of course this picture is not real, but you can imagine a big boat made basically of wood and using the main power of the wind! Remember that this picture needs to be uploaded to the Hills Server (your account) together with this file you are modifying, otherwise, the picture will not be shown!</p>


<p>You will be able to change a little bit the content of the two paragraphs below to insert the links requested to make sense when reading the content.</p>

<p>The link to be inserted here should open in a new window or tab.</p>

<p>This second link will take you to a web page to a target reference name within that page. This link should also open in a new window or tab.</p>

<p>Include here below a horizontal ruler to divide the page</p>

<H2>Subtitle of our page</H2>
<p>It's funny to see this page being upgraded<br>
We will be dealing with a lot of details in this code<br>
and that's the idea of this exercise!</p>

<section>
	<h3>The W3 Validator says this section needs a heading!</h3>
<p>At least I am using one new HTML5 tag - the section tag. Not sure if I am using it correctly!</p>
</section>

<p>I am trying to build an unordered list here below. Would you be able to help me?</p>
<ul>
	<li>planning a web page</li>
	<li>studying the target audience</li>
	<li>following standards when coding</li>
</ul>

<p>Make sure you upload your file to Hills, inside the public_html folder, make sure also to upload the image of the oldboat but, especially for his work, make sure you validate your code!</p>
