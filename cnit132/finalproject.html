<p><strong>About me:</strong> When I am not swimming with dolphins in Mexico, I work in tech, walk my dog, write fiction, practice yoga, and enjoy time with my friends.</p>

<p>My path into and around web development has been circuitous. I have worked in web infrastructure since 1998, along side designers, front end developers, applications developers, and the like. I'd never coded a web page until 1999 when I spun up a very amateurishly designed web magazine using MS Front Page. It was completely static html.  A few years later I created a marketing web page for a yoga business I started that never got off the ground. This design was a little better. You can see that site on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120715004039/http://yogadelivery.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wayback machine</a>.  In years since, I have continued working in web infrastructure, or giving the web code a place to call home, but haven't touched html until CS131H this semester.  I had forgotten how fun it is to create web pages, and the joy of seeing the pages go live on the Internet.

My favorite website is also my last employer, <a href="https://medium.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Medium</a>. I've always appreciated the clean design, the user generated content, and my team and I worked hard to keep the infrastructure operational behind the scenes.</p>

<!--
TODO
DONE a/ layout with grid or flexbox -> done, used grid
    > DONE: figure out the grid-gap so you don't have the janky right edge
    > NOT DOING: links, figure out how to get rid of the extra space to align with the title "some interesting links"
b/ use semantic tags (header, nav, main, etc)
    > DONE: when I tried to use "nav" instead of "aside" for left hand nav, page got janky, leave with aside? works now with nav, shrug
    > DONE: other semantic tags (note: div is not a semantic tag, don't use it) except I had to with the grid. shrug.
c/ DONE layout of page with the image given - used same css on all three pages (diff for meetup-grid.html)
d/ DONE bg color - chose gray, body background is that blue color - checked visibility for color blindness
e/ DONE header section
f/ menu section 
    > DONE ENOUGH: "the whole container having menu, heading, content and footer would be centralized within the width of the browser"  - centralize text within width of browser - used  id="center" in h1 + footer + ul + main to center text, but what else? do I want the main text centered in the column? > decided no
    > DONE: add shadow, get rid of extra space below footer
    DONE ENOUGH: Center top H1 vertically in its section

  g/ DONE contact page - see contact.html for TODOs
  h/ DONE contact form on contact page - see contact.html for TODOs
  i/ DONE update link on finalproject.html to contact.html
  j/ DONE footer - add copyright, name, email + email link
  k/ DONE update meetup link in all three pages
  l/ DONE assignments and contact pages have same design & layout - used same finalproject.css for all pages
  m/ DONE add favicon (smirking cat)

Other TODOs:
DONE + update meetup-grid.html with left hand nav (in aside) - submitted with placeholder text
DONE + update any changes to layout/design on meetup-grid.html
