<section><h2>History of My Menagerie</h2>
<article>
<h3>It started with a pair of cats</h3>

<p>On Mother's Day in 2000, I brought home a pair of kittens. One was all black, I named her "Unagi", her sister was black with white markings, I named her "Maguro". Perhaps you recognize these are kinds of sushi. I called them my Sushi Cats. </p>
<p>Then, in 2011, my partner and daughter brought home a dog, which was odd, considering my then 9 year old daughter was afraid of dogs, but not this one! He charmed his way into our hearts.  My daughter wanted to name him "Hot Dog" or "Brownie". We decided on Brownie, but mostly we call him "Brown".</p>
<p>Sadly, the cats left their cat suits, Magi first in 2013, then Unagi in 2017.</p>
<p>During the pandemic, my daughter and I decided we needed kittens to keep us from going stir-crazy, so in 2020 we adopted another female black cat we called "Milk Tea" and her brother, who is black and white we call "Tapioca".</p>

<p>When we get to the part where we add photos, I'll update this page :) </p>

<h2>About The Menagerie</h2>
<h3>The Sushi Cats</h3>
<p>The Sushis were my first cats  I had as an adult. Magi loved affection, but hated to be picked up.  Unagi would let me carry her around draped over my shoulder, so that all of my t-shirts had claw-holes on the left shoulder.<br>
I miss them.</p>

<h3>A Dog Named Brown</h3>
<p>Brown is, by my best guess, a terrier-dachshund-mystery mix. He's about 18 pounds, with a sweet underbite and undeniable charm that brings him adoration and many treats.  </p>

<p>Brown and I take daily walks through McLaren Park, where I admire trees, and he greets his dog friends.</p>

<h3>The Boba Cats</h3>
<p>Milk Tea, who we call "Teaks" is a petite female black cat, who wiggles around in my lap until I pet her.</p>
<p>Tapioca, who we call "Taps" is a larger male black and white cat, with a tuxedo belly, and white whiskers. He lays on top of me and purrs.</p>
<p>They both bring me many gifts from outside, including a lizard today, and yesterday a clod of dirt. One week they brought me a mouse every day. I tell them I appreciate the gifts but I'm not hungry.</p>

<p>Tapioca loves Brown and tries to groom him. Brown growls but doesn't bite. I've tried to tell Brown that Tapioca thinks he's a cat.</p>
