<!-- TODO

3/ and how to make the banner animated :/
4/ and the rest of the list ... 

You will also include a banner that might show up at the top (above the airplane) or at the bottom (below the airplane) 
that should show the words FLY WITH US, WE ARE SAFE. The animation of this banner should contain the following features:
The banner will come from the left side of the browser
The banner will go to the right side of the browser WITHOUT SHOWING HORIZONTAL SCROLLING OF THE BROWSER 
    (meaning you will need to use the calc(100% - WidthOfElement) 
    so no part of the banner will get out of the browser on the right but the banner will go completely to the right side)
Then, the banner will end at the middle of the width of the browser
While the banner is moving, you should also include some type of rotation, or expansion of the font

> remember to check caniuse
> rem to check validator.w3.org !!!

DONE:
1/ figure out why clouds are at the bottom of the page :/ -> done!
2/ figure out why the banner text disappears when the clouds move -> put the banner at the bottom, that works!
