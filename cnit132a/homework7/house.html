   <h2>Shaping around the house</h2>

  <p>Once upon a time there was a house. This house had a lovely house shape, in fact, the shape was so lovely that we had an 
    assignment to write a few paragraphs that wrap around the shape of the house. Which is what this is.</p>

<p>This is the second paragraph that wraps around this lovely house. See how nice the house is nestled up against these words? 
    It is almost as if the house is welcoming the words to come in and stay a while.
</p>

<p>But of course, that is silly. It is an image of a house, and these are words and punctuation hanging out next to the house. 
    It's nice to imagine silly things sometimes, though!</p>

<!-- TODO
1/ figure out what a container query is, then code that based on this:
You will add a simple container query so that the h2 will be smaller if the parent element (the container) 
is less than 600px (600 pixels).
