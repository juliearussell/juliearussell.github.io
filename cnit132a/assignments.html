The assignment in which we learned to optimize images for enhanced website performance
without sacrificing visual quality.</p>

<p><strong>Homework 5:</strong> <a href="movies.html">Using Microdata & WAI ARIA Role Attributes to improve accessibility in web pages</a><br>
Developing webpages that are accessible to everyone is critical and in the USA, it's the law. 
In this assignment we learned how to use microdata and WAI ARIA role attributes to improve accessibility of our pages.</p>

<p><strong>Homework 6:</strong> Using SASS and SCSS to add functions and variables to web pages<br>
Although this assignment was not uploaded as a webpage to our course sites, we learned how to use variables and functions
in our CSS code with preprocessing languages Synactically Awesome Stylesheets(SASS) and Sassy CSS (SCSS).</p>

<p><strong>Homework 7 Part 1:</strong> <a href="homework7/hw7.html">Using CSS to add animations to web pages</a><br>
Animations add visual interest and intrigue to web pages, although it's important to be mindful of visitors
who may be sensitive to this kind of movement!  In this assignment, we learned to use CSS to animate the cloud
background image to make the plane appear to move, and also add a moving banner that respects the dimension of the viewable screen.</p>

<p><strong>Homework 7 Part 2: </strong><a href="homework7/house.html">Wrapping text around images with CSS</a><br>
This was a fun assignment, where we learned to use CSS Shapes to wrap text around this house shape, 
and a container query to adapt the size of heading two based on the size of the container.</p>

<h3>And so, we arrive at the final two assignments for the Advanced HTML & CSS course!</h3>
<p><strong> Homework 8 Part 1:</strong> <a href="hw8-part1-seo.html">Using Search Words to improve SEO</a><br>
Without SEO, how will visitors find my website? In this assignment we use keywords, and other elements to improve native SEO.</p>

<p><strong> Homework 8 Part 2:</strong> <a href="hw8-part2-analytics.html">Analytics Report</a><br>
At the start of this course, I added a google analytics tag to the main four pages in the left hand nav. 
This is where I show the results and see if anyone visited in the past few months!</p>
