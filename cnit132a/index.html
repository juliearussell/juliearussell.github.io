          <strong>Hello everyone!</strong>
          I am a lifelong learner who continues to take courses at City College of San Francisco while working full tme. 
          I created this blog-like website for the Advanced HTML & CSS (CNIT132) 
          City College of San Francisco (CCSF) course I am taking Spring 2024.<br>
          When I am not studying HTML and CSS, or swimming with dolphins in
          Mexico, I work in tech, walk my dog, write fiction, and practice yoga.
        </p>

          Although I've worked in web infrastructure for two decades, 
          my path into and around web development has been circuitous. 
          I have worked along side designers, front
          end developers, applications developers, and every other role involved in 
          the creation and maintenance of many web applications. I first coded
          a web page in 1999 when I spun up a very amateurishly designed web
          magazine using MS Front Page (RIP). It was completely static html. A few
          years later I created a marketing web page for a yoga business I
          started that never got off the ground. This design was a little
          better. You can see that site on the
          <a
            href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120715004039/http://yogadelivery.com/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer">Wayback Machine</a>.</p> 
            
            <p>In years since, I have continued working in web infrastructure, or
          giving the web code a place to call home, but haven't touched html
          until CNIT131H, CCSF's Intro to HTML and CSS course last year. I had forgotten how fun it is to create
          web pages, and the joy of seeing the pages go live on the Internet. My
          favorite website is also my previous employer,
          <a href="https://medium.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >Medium</a>. I've always appreciated the clean design (knowing simple is hard!), the user generated
          content, the ad-free platform, and my team and I worked hard to keep the infrastructure
          operational behind the scenes. It's also a fantastic resource for articles on HTML, CSS, and other technologies.

        It is easy to fall prey to imposter syndrome, this post reminds me I
        am likely doing better than I believe.</p>

        What does happen when you open a web page, or click on this link?
        It's easy to forget what's happening under the hood.</p>

            Python was the first language I learned, along with "import this",
