I have worked in web infrastructure since 1998, along side designers, front end developers, applications developers, and the like. I'd never coded a web page until 1999 when I spun up a very amateurishly designed web magazine using MS Front Page. It was completely static html. A few years later I created a marketing web page for a yoga business I started that never got off the ground. This design was a little better. You can see that site on the <a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20120715004039/http://yogadelivery.com/ rel="noopener noreferrer"target=_blank>wayback machine</a>. In years since, I have continued working in web infrastructure, or giving the web code a place to call home, but haven't touched html until CS131H last year. I had forgotten how fun it is to create web pages, and the joy of seeing the pages go live on the Internet. My favorite website is also my last employer, <a href=https://medium.com rel="noopener noreferrer"target=_blank>Medium</a>. I've always appreciated the clean design, the user generated content, and my team and I worked hard to keep the infrastructure operational behind the scenes.</p><a href=https://www.techopedia.com/2/31579/networks/a-brief-history-of-web-development#the-turn-of-the-century rel="noopener noreferrer"target=_blank>Brief History of Web Development: The Turn of the Century</a><hr><h2>Some Interesting Links</h2><ul><li><a href=https://medium.com/developer-purpose/youre-not-an-imposter-developers-are-all-faking-it-145a04e9cef4 rel="noopener noreferrer"target=_blank>Medium: You're not an imposter.
